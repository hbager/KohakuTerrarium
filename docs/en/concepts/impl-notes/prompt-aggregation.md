# Prompt aggregation

## The problem this solves

An agent's "system prompt" is not one string. It is a composition of:

- the creature's personality / role,
- a list of available tools (names + descriptions),
- how to actually call tools in this creature's chosen format,
- any channel topology (in a terrarium),
- a description of named outputs (so the LLM knows when to route to
  Discord vs stdout),
- tool-contributed guidance paragraphs (for tools that want to teach the
  model how to use them well),
- plugin-contributed sections (project rules, environment info, etc.),
- optional full documentation for every tool (if in `static` skill
  mode), or none of it (if in `dynamic` mode),
- a procedural-skill index and on-demand skill bodies.

If you leave this to hand-written prompts, you ship bugs: stale tool
lists, wrong call syntax, duplicated sections. The framework
assembles the whole thing deterministically.

## Options considered

- **Hand-written prompts.** Fragile. Breaks whenever you add a tool.
- **Always-full static prompts.** Complete but huge; tool docs alone
  can be tens of kilotokens.
- **Load-on-demand docs.** Ship names only; let the agent pull full
  docs via the `info` framework command when needed.
- **Procedural skills as full inline bodies.** Powerful but too expensive
  when a creature discovers many local/user/project skills.
- **Configurable.** Each creature picks the trade-off: `skill_mode:
  dynamic` or `skill_mode: static`; procedural skills get a separate
  byte-budgeted index.

## What we actually do

`prompt/aggregator.py:aggregate_system_prompt(...)` concatenates
sections in this order:

1. **Base prompt.** Rendered with Jinja2 (safe-undefined fallback);
   contains the creature's personality and any project context files
   declared under `prompt_context_files`.
2. **Tool section.**
   - `skill_mode: dynamic` → tool *index*: name + one-line description
     per tool. Agent loads full docs on demand via the `info` framework command.
   - `skill_mode: static` → full documentation for every tool inline.
3. **Tool guidance section.** Deterministic aggregation of every tool's
   `prompt_contribution()` output, ordered by bucket (`first`, `normal`,
   `last`) and then alphabetically within each bucket.
4. **Procedural-skill index.** A byte-budgeted `## Skills` section built
   from discovered skills. Only enabled, model-invocable skills are listed.
   Overflow skills remain reachable through `##skill <name>##` or
   `##info <name>##`.
5. **Channel topology section** (terrarium creatures only). Describes
   "you listen on X, Y; you can send on Z; here is who sits on the
   other side." Emitted by
   `terrarium/config.py:build_channel_topology_prompt`.
6. **Framework hints.** How to call tools in this creature's format
   (bracket / XML / native), how to use the inline framework commands
   (`read_job`, `info`, `jobs`, `wait`, and `skill` when present), and
   what the output protocol looks like.
7. **Named outputs section.** For each `named_outputs.<name>`, a short
   description of when to route text there.
8. **Prompt plugin sections.** Each registered prompt plugin (priority
   sorted, low→high) contributes one section. Built-ins:
   `ToolListPlugin`, `FrameworkHintsPlugin`, `EnvInfoPlugin`,
   `ProjectInstructionsPlugin`.

Framework-hint prose itself is now overrideable. The aggregator merges
package-level `framework_hints:` overrides from `kohaku.yaml` with any
creature-level `framework_hint_overrides`, then resolves four canonical
blocks: output model, dynamic execution model, static execution model,
and native execution model.

MCP tools, when connected, are injected as an extra section under
"Available MCP Tools" with per-server bullet lists.

## Invariants preserved

- **Deterministic.** Given the same config + registry + plugin set,
  the prompt is byte-stable.
- **Auto sections never duplicate hand-written ones.** If you put a
  tool list in your `system.md`, the aggregator's tool list is still
  added; the framework does not deduplicate by content.
- **Skill mode is a knob, not a policy.** Nothing else in the system
  changes based on `skill_mode`; it is exclusively a prompt-size
  trade-off.
- **Skill index is budgeted, not all-or-nothing.** Procedural skills
  are indexed up to `skill_index_budget_bytes`; missing ones are still
  callable explicitly.
- **Tool guidance is cache-stable.** Bucket ordering plus alphabetical
  sort keeps prompt prefixes stable for provider-side prompt caching.
- **Plugin order is explicit.** Priority sorted. Same priority → stable
  insertion order.

## Where it lives in the code

- `src/kohakuterrarium/prompt/aggregator.py`: the composition function.
- `src/kohakuterrarium/prompt/plugins.py`: built-in prompt plugins.
- `src/kohakuterrarium/prompt/templates.py`: Jinja safe rendering.
- `src/kohakuterrarium/terrarium/config.py`: channel topology block.
- `src/kohakuterrarium/core/agent.py`: `_init_controller()` calls the
  aggregator once on start.
