# Sessions

For readers persisting, resuming, or archiving agent runs.

A session captures the operational state of a run (conversation, events, sub-agent conversations, channel history, scratchpad, jobs, resumable triggers, and config metadata) as a single `.kohakutr` file. You can stop a creature at any point and resume exactly where it left off.

Concept primer: [memory and compaction](../concepts/modules/memory-and-compaction.md), [session and environment](../concepts/modules/session-and-environment.md).

## The `.kohakutr` file

`.kohakutr` is a SQLite database (via KohakuVault) with nine tables:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `meta` | session metadata, config snapshot, terrarium topology |
| `state` | per-agent scratchpad, turn count, cumulative token usage, resumable triggers |
| `events` | append-only log of every text chunk, tool call, trigger, token usage event |
| `channels` | channel message history keyed by channel name |
| `subagents` | sub-agent conversation snapshots keyed by parent + name + run |
| `jobs` | tool and sub-agent job records |
| `conversation` | latest conversation snapshot per agent (for fast resume) |
| `fts` | FTS5 index over events (for `kt search`) |
| `vectors` | optional embedding column (populated by `kt embedding`) |

The format is append-only for event data and versioned through KohakuVault's auto-pack. Binary artifacts can also live in a sibling `<session>.artifacts/` directory, so when a run generated images or other binary outputs, archive the `.kohakutr` file and its artifacts directory together.

## Where sessions live

```
~/.kohakuterrarium/sessions/<name>.kohakutr
```

`<name>` is auto-generated from the creature/terrarium name plus a timestamp. Override with `--session <path>` or opt out with `--no-session`.

## What persists

On each turn KohakuTerrarium records:

- **Conversation snapshots**: raw message dicts via msgpack. Preserves `tool_calls`, multimodal content, and metadata.
- **Event log**: one entry per chunk, tool call, sub-agent output, trigger fire, channel message, compact, interrupt, or error. This is the canonical history.
- **Sub-agent conversations**: saved before the sub-agent is destroyed, so you can inspect what it did after the fact.
- **Scratchpad and channel messages**: per-agent and per-channel.
- **Job records**: outputs of long-running tools and sub-agents.
- **Resumable triggers**: any `BaseTrigger` subclass with `resumable: True` serializes to `state` and restores on resume.
- **Config snapshot**: the fully-resolved config at run time, so resume can rebuild the agent even if the on-disk config changed.
- **Binary artifacts**: generated images and similar binary outputs written under `<session>.artifacts/` beside the session file.

## Resuming

```bash
kt resume --last            # most recent session
kt resume                   # interactive picker (10 most-recent shown)
kt resume my-agent_20240101 # by name prefix
kt resume ~/backup/run.kohakutr
```

Resume is auto-detected: agent sessions mount a single creature; terrarium sessions mount the full wiring and force TUI mode.

Flags the same as `kt run`: `--mode`, `--llm`, `--log-level`, plus `--pwd <dir>` to override the working directory.

Programmatic resume mirrors this (see [Sessions from Python](#sessions-from-python)):

```python
from kohakuterrarium import Terrarium

# Fresh engine from a saved session...
engine = await Terrarium.resume("runs/swe_20240101.kohakutr", pwd="/work", llm=None)

# ...or adopt into an engine that's already running other graphs.
graph_id = await engine.adopt_session("runs/other.kohakutr")
```

Both accept a path or a `SessionStore`; `llm=` is an optional selector
string override. A file that exists but cannot be resumed (unknown
saved-session type, missing config path in the metadata) raises a
`ValueError`.

What resume does:

1. Reads the config snapshot from `meta`.
2. Reloads the current on-disk config (so prompt/tool changes you made since take effect).
3. Merges: config snapshot provides the session identity; current config provides the running logic.
4. Rebuilds the agent, attaches the same `SessionStore`, reinjects the conversation snapshot, replays scratchpad/channel/trigger state.
5. Starts the controller fresh; previous events are in context.

This means small config drift is fine (swapping an LLM, changing a prompt). Structural drift (renaming the creature, removing a tool it was actively using) can cause replay errors; pin a session to its original config if you need perfect fidelity.

## Interrupt and resume workflow

```bash
kt run @kt-biome/creatures/swe
# work... then Ctrl+C twice while idle (or Ctrl+D / /exit)
# later:
kt resume --last
```

In Rich CLI mode, Ctrl+C interrupts the active turn; when idle, pressing Ctrl+C twice (or Ctrl+D / `/exit`) exits gracefully, flushes the session store, and prints a resume hint. Forced kills (SIGKILL) skip the final flush but most recent state is still on disk thanks to append-only writes.

## Copying or archiving sessions

```bash
# Backup
cp ~/.kohakuterrarium/sessions/swe_20240101.kohakutr ~/backups/
cp -r ~/.kohakuterrarium/sessions/swe_20240101.artifacts ~/backups/   # if present

# Resume from a moved location
kt resume ~/backups/swe_20240101.kohakutr
```

Inspect without resuming via `SessionReader` (below); it opens the
file read-only, so inspection never touches `status` or `last_active`.

## Sessions from Python

### Creating sessions: engine-owned persistence

Persistence is a keyword on the engine; the framework writes and
validates the session metadata itself:

```python
from kohakuterrarium import Terrarium

# Autosession: every graph gets <session_dir>/<graph_id>.kohakutr
# automatically (merge/split children land there too).
engine = Terrarium(session_dir="runs/")

# Per-creature control via session=:
c = await engine.add_creature(
    "@kt-biome/creatures/general",
    session="runs/student-42.kohakutr",   # mint the store at this exact path
)
# session=True   -> mint in the default session dir
# session=False  -> no persistence, even under autosession
# session=<SessionStore> -> attach an existing store as-is
# session=None (default) -> follow the engine (autosession / graph store / off)

# Recipes: one terrarium-typed store for the whole graph.
await engine.apply_recipe("@kt-biome/terrariums/swe_team", session="runs/team.kohakutr")
```

`await engine.shutdown()` (or leaving the `async with` block) closes
every store the engine minted, so files no longer get stuck at
`status: "running"`.

### Resuming

- `await Terrarium.resume(store_or_path, *, pwd=None, llm=None)`:
  build a fresh engine and adopt the saved session.
- `await engine.adopt_session(store_or_path, *, pwd=None, llm=None)`:
  resume into a running engine; returns the new `graph_id`.

Resume reconstructs topology from the config path recorded in the
session metadata (`@pkg` refs included) and runs with a per-agent
working directory; it does not `os.chdir` your process.

### Reading: `SessionReader`

`SessionReader` is the read-only inspection surface over a
`.kohakutr` file. It opens via `SessionStore.open_readonly`, so
reading never bumps `last_active` or flips `status`:

```python
from kohakuterrarium import SessionReader

with SessionReader("~/backups/swe_20240101.kohakutr") as r:
    print(r.meta["status"], r.agents)

    for turn in r.turns():               # live-branch turns, reassembled
        tools = [tc["name"] for tc in turn.tool_calls]
        print(f"[{turn.source}] {turn.user_text!r} -> "
              f"{turn.assistant_text[:60]!r} tools={tools}")

    events = r.events()                  # the raw append-only log
    convo = r.conversation()             # final snapshot (message dicts)
    chan = r.channel_messages("tasks")   # one channel's history

    r.index()                            # ad-hoc FTS index, then:
    hits = r.search("score.json", k=5)
```

`turns()` skips regenerated / edited siblings, so you see the same live
branch every viewer shows. `search()` returns hits only for indexed
sessions (`kt embedding`, or `reader.index()` for FTS ad hoc).

If you need raw read-write access, `SessionStore(path)` is still
there, but for any listing / preview / viewer purpose use
`SessionStore.open_readonly(path)` (or just `SessionReader`): a plain
open + close marks the session paused and bumps `last_active`,
corrupting recency ordering.

## Compaction

Compaction shrinks the conversation when context fills up. Configure per creature:

```yaml
compact:
  enabled: true
  threshold: 0.8              # compact when context hits 80% of window
  target: 0.5                 # aim for 50% after compaction
  keep_recent_turns: 5        # always preserve the last N turns verbatim
  compact_model: gpt-4o-mini  # cheaper model for the summarization pass
```

Compaction runs in the background (see [concepts/modules/memory-and-compaction](../concepts/modules/memory-and-compaction.md)): the controller keeps running; when the new summary is ready, the conversation is swapped. Each compaction is logged as an event.

Manual compaction:

```
/compact
```

from the CLI/TUI prompt. Useful before handing off a long session or shipping it as context into another run.

## Listing and searching sessions

The `kt serve` web UI and `GET /api/sessions` are backed by a
sidecar index: one SQLite file at
`<session_dir>/.kt-index.kvault` that caches listing-shape metadata
(name, status, last-active timestamp, agents, preview, …) per
session and exposes BM25 search over the text columns. You never
interact with it directly; it stays consistent across server
restarts and `kt run` sessions started while the server was down.

Query parameters on `GET /api/sessions`:

| Param | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `limit` | `20` | page size |
| `offset` | `0` | page offset |
| `search` | `""` | FTS5 query over `name` / `preview` / `config_path` / `agents` / `pwd` |
| `sort` | `last_active` | `last_active` \| `created_at` \| `name` \| `status` \| `relevance` |
| `order` | `desc` | `desc` \| `asc` |
| `status` | (none) | exact match (`running`, `paused`, …) |
| `config_type` | (none) | exact match (`agent`, `terrarium`) |
| `node_id` | (none) | exact match; filter by which lab node ran the session |
| `refresh` | `false` | incremental reconcile before listing; re-reads only files whose `(mtime, size)` changed |
| `full_rescan` | `false` | force re-read of every file (use after manually editing a `.kohakutr` on disk) |

`sort=relevance` is only meaningful when `search` is set; with any
other sort, the FTS hit-set is collected first and then ordered by
the requested field.

How the index stays in sync without manual refresh:

- **Push.** While the API server is running, each `SessionStore` it
  owns pushes updates into the index on a debounce (every 20 events
  or 5 seconds, whichever first), so the index never falls behind
  during normal use.
- **Startup reconcile.** On every server start, the index does a
  fingerprint-diff pass over the session directory and re-reads only
  the files that changed. First-ever startup does a full read of
  every file (the *bootstrap* step) and remembers it succeeded.
- **`?refresh=true`.** Trigger the same incremental reconcile on
  demand; useful right after copying a backup `.kohakutr` into the
  session directory.

The sidecar is safe to delete: the next listing rebuilds it from
the `.kohakutr` files. Nothing inside the index is unique state.

Programmatic listing without the HTTP layer:

```python
from kohakuterrarium.studio.persistence.session_index import (
    get_session_index_default,
)

index = get_session_index_default()
page = index.list(search="auth bug", sort="relevance", limit=10)
for row in page.rows:
    print(row["name"], row["last_active"], row["preview"])
```

## Memory search

Sessions are also a searchable knowledge base. After building an index:

```bash
kt embedding ~/.kohakuterrarium/sessions/swe.kohakutr
kt search swe "auth bug"
```

The agent itself can search with the `search_memory` tool. Full walk-through: [Memory](memory.md).

## Disabling persistence

Sometimes you want a throwaway run:

```bash
kt run @kt-biome/creatures/swe --no-session
```

No `.kohakutr` is created. This also disables compaction's ability to recover previous rounds from disk (it still compacts in memory).

## Troubleshooting

- **Compaction runs forever / OOMs.** The compact model is the same heavy controller model. Set `compact_model` to something cheap (`gpt-4o-mini`, `claude-haiku`).
- **Resume errors with `tool not registered`.** The creature config changed (a tool was removed) but the conversation still references it. Manually edit `config.yaml` to re-add the tool, or start a fresh session.
- **`kt resume` can't find a session I just saw.** Sessions are resolved by prefix against filenames in `~/.kohakuterrarium/sessions/`. If you renamed the file or moved it, pass the full path.
- **Generated images are missing after copying a session.** Copy the sibling `<session>.artifacts/` directory too, not just the `.kohakutr` file.
- **Large `.kohakutr` files.** The event log is append-only; long sessions grow. Archive old ones or split work across sessions. Compaction shrinks the live conversation but keeps the full event history for search.
- **Sub-agent output missing from resume.** Sub-agent conversations are saved when the sub-agent completes. If the parent was interrupted mid-sub-agent, the latest snapshot is whatever was persisted at the last checkpoint.
