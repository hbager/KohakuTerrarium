"""Expose process metrics and live runtime gauges through one snapshot route.

Histogram and rate data comes from the process-wide aggregator, while gauges
that represent current runtime state are read from sessions and the host
engine. Keeping both sources in one response lets dashboard consumers poll a
single endpoint. Histograms are recomputed on every request because the
calculation is cheap and caching would make the snapshot stale.
