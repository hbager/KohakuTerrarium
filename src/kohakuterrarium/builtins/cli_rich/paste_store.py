"""In-memory store for large pastes represented by placeholder tokens.

When a user pastes a chunk of text that's large enough to overwhelm the
composer visually (too many lines, too many chars), we substitute a
placeholder token of the form ``[#pasted-42 · 87 lines]`` into the
visible buffer and keep the real content in this store. On submit, the
composer replaces each placeholder with its stashed content so the
agent sees the actual paste text.

Design goals:
  - Placeholders are a fixed-width visual token so the composer doesn't
    reflow wildly as the user edits around them.
  - Ids are short integers so the token stays compact.
  - Store is per-process, in memory, never persisted. Dropped on exit.

This mirrors the "[Pasted text #N]" pattern in claude-code and
"[pasted N lines]" in gemini-cli.
