"""Per-agent runtime working-directory controller.

Composition helper attached to :class:`~kohakuterrarium.core.agent.Agent`
as ``agent.workspace``. Switches the agent's effective ``cwd`` mid-session
without rebuilding the agent.

Refresh checklist (kept in lockstep with ``bootstrap/agent_init``):

* ``agent.executor._working_dir`` — every ``ToolContext`` is built from
  this on demand (see ``Executor._build_tool_context``), so updating
  the attribute is enough — no per-tool reset needed.
* ``agent._path_guard`` is rebuilt with the new cwd (and the same
  ``mode``) and re-pointed at ``executor._path_guard``. Without this,
  paths inside the new tree would still trip the warn-once guard.
* ``agent._file_read_state`` is cleared. Read-before-write tracking
  is path-keyed; stale entries from the old tree could mislead
  subsequent ``edit`` / ``write`` calls.
* Sub-agents share the parent's executor reference
  (``subagent_manager._parent_executor``), so their tool contexts
  pick up the new cwd automatically.
* ``agent.session_store.meta["pwd"]`` is updated so resume restores
  the latest cwd, not the initial one.

Constraints:

* Reject when ``agent._processing_task`` is alive — switching mid-turn
  would let some in-flight tools see the old cwd while others see the
  new one. Callers should interrupt first.
* Process-wide ``os.chdir`` is *not* called: the serving manager runs
  many agents in one process; chdir would cross-contaminate cwd for
  every agent.
