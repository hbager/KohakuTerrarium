            "back-and-forth; reach for a private sub-agent when the work "

            "`group_spawn_child(config_ref, task?, name?)` spawns a "
            "child into your graph, auto-wires a default two-way channel "
            "between you and it, and (if `task` is given) hands it that "
            "first task immediately. This is the fast path for "
            '"spin up a worker and put it to work"; the manual steps '
            "below are for finer control (custom channel topologies, "
            "output-wire pipelines, wiring existing nodes).\n\n"
            "**Manual team-building workflow** (call in order):\n\n"
            "  1. `group_status` — snapshot the current group. Pass "
            "`include_spawnable=true` to see which creature configs "
            "you can spawn (e.g. `@<pkg>/creatures/<name>`). Run this "
            "before dispatching so you know who is already wired and "
            "what is available.\n"
            "  2. `group_add_node(config_path, name?, pwd?)` — spawn a "
            "worker into your graph WITHOUT wiring it. Pass `pwd=` to "
            "give the worker its own working directory; omit to inherit "
            "yours. The worker starts isolated — nothing reaches it "
            "until you wire it (use `group_spawn_child` instead to spawn "
            "AND wire in one call).\n"
            '  3. `group_channel(action="create", channel, '
            "description)` — declare a channel for routing messages. "
            "Channels are broadcast: every listener receives every "
            "send. A creature's own messages are filtered out, so do "
            "not rely on self-loops to drive iteration.\n"
            '  4. `group_channel(action="wire", channel, '
            'creature_id, direction)` — `direction` is `"listen"` OR '
            '`"send"` (one edge per call; call twice for both). Typical '
            "dispatch pattern: you `send` and workers `listen` on a "
            "task channel; workers `send` and you `listen` on a "
            "results channel.\n"
            '  5. `group_wire(action="add", from, to, with_content?)` '
            "— optional output-wire when you want a worker's final turn "
            "text auto-delivered to another creature (`from`/`to` are "
            "creature ids or names) without an explicit send. Use "
            "channels for dispatch, wires for pipeline hand-off.\n"
            "  6. `send_channel(channel, message)` to broadcast, or "
            "`group_send(to, message)` for a one-shot direct delivery "
            "to a single creature. From this point workers wake up "
            "and run their own loops in parallel; you stay free to "
            "plan, dispatch more work, or read replies on your listen "
            "channels.\n\n"
            "**Lifecycle — four distinct verbs, keep them straight:**\n"
            "  - `group_pause_node(creature_id)` / "
            "`group_resume_node(creature_id)` — **warm pause**: the "
            "worker stops admitting new turns but stays live and warm; "
            "resume re-admits and drains anything that queued while "
            "paused. Use this to hold a worker briefly.\n"
            "  - `group_stop_node(creature_id)` — **force-stop**: a full "
            "teardown (NOT a pause). The worker stops servicing events; "
            "its session is preserved and `group_start_node(creature_id)` "
            "restarts it cold.\n"
            "  - `group_kill_node(creature_id)` — force-stop **plus** a "
            "`killed` marker. Hard kill is not supported in a shared "
            "process, so this is an honest force-stop, not a fake "
            "SIGKILL.\n"
            "  - `group_remove_node(creature_id)` — destroy a "
            "non-privileged worker outright. Tear down channels / wires "
            'touching it first (`group_channel(action="unwire"|'
            '"delete", …)`, `group_wire(action="remove", …)`) for a '
            "clean snapshot.\n\n"

            "`status` field — one of `not_started`, `idle`, `busy`, "
            "`stopped`, `error` — plus `paused` / `killed` flags. "
            "`busy` means a controller turn is in flight (your dispatch "
            "queues rather than preempts); `idle` means the worker is "
            "ready for the next message; `paused` means it is warm but "
