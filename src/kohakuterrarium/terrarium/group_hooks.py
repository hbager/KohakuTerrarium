"""Studio-supplied hooks for the group tool surface.

The ``terrarium`` layer must not import from ``studio``. Studio instead
registers optional hooks here for session attachment, display-name propagation,
workspace resolution, and the spawnable-creature catalog.

When no hook is registered, calls degrade gracefully:

- :func:`attach_session_store` becomes a no-op (the spawned creature
  still runs, just without persistence).
- :func:`apply_creature_name` falls back to ``creature.name = name``.
- :func:`list_spawnable` returns an empty list (the model's
  ``group_status`` simply omits the catalog).
- :func:`resolve_workspace` returns ``None`` (workspace-scoped lookups
  fall back to package-only).

This keeps ``terrarium`` runnable in tests and headless usage without
the studio layer present.
