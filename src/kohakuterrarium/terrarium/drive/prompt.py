    "A drive is a durable, assignable commitment the runtime delivers to you as "
    "an ordinary event. You interpret it, act with your normal tools, and report "
    "outcomes — the runtime owns identity, delivery, and recovery.\n"
    "- Ownership: you may create and manage your own drives; a drive owned by "
    "someone else that is merely assigned to you is report/propose-only — you "
    "may set it to 'waiting' or 'blocked' to suspend pursuit (use 'blocked' when "
    "you need user intervention), but do not cancel, reassign, retire, or pause "
    "it.\n"
    "- Recovery: a redelivered drive may follow an attempt that already ran side "
    "effects. Inspect current state and reconcile before repeating actions.\n"
    "- Delivery: the active Drive's projected objective and identity arrive in "
    "the event that starts the turn. Act on that projection directly; do not begin "
    "by listing or inspecting Drives unless required information is actually missing.\n"
    "- Progress: report material progress with evidence rather than narrating.\n"
    "- Completion: propose completion or failure with evidence for verification; "
    "do not assert a terminal outcome yourself.\n"
    "- Budgets: obey declared budgets; exhausting a budget stops continuation "
    "without changing the drive's status — it never completes and never resumes "
    "on its own. Recovery is an explicit owner act (raise the budget and wake)."
