"""Engine-side topology lifecycle helpers — disconnect, split
bookkeeping, channel removal.

Split out of :mod:`terrarium.channels` to keep that file under the
600-line per-file budget. The functions here are tightly coupled:

- :func:`disconnect_creatures` is the body of
  :meth:`Terrarium.disconnect` — drops listen/send edges, removes
  triggers, and may propagate a split.
- :func:`apply_split_bookkeeping` runs after any topology mutation
  that may have produced a split (creature removal, channel removal,
  edge unwiring). It allocates envs for new components, registers
  topology channels into them, repoints affected creatures, and
  re-injects listen triggers so messages flow on the new env's
  channel objects.
- :func:`remove_channel_from_graph` is the body of
  :meth:`Terrarium.remove_channel` — tears down listen triggers,
  drops the channel from the live registry, removes it from topology
  (which may propagate a split), and runs split bookkeeping.

Lives next to :mod:`terrarium.channels` rather than at engine layer
because every function here reaches into the channel registry +
trigger machinery owned by that module. The dependency is one-way
(this module imports ``channels``; ``channels`` does not import
back), satisfying the dep-graph cycle check.
