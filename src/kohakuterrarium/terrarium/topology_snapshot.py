"""Runtime-topology snapshot + replay.

Recipes define the initial graph; this module preserves subsequent in-memory
channel and wire changes across close and resume.

This module captures the live topology as a primitive-dict snapshot
into the graph's :class:`SessionStore` ``meta`` after every mutation,
and replays the additions on top of the recipe-rebuilt topology at
resume time. The result: any channel / wire the user added survives
a close + reopen.

Snapshot shape (under ``meta["runtime_topology"]``):

::

    {
        "channels": [{"name": str, "description": str}, ...],
        "listen_edges": {creature_id: [channel_name, ...]},
        "send_edges":   {creature_id: [channel_name, ...]},
    }

Replay logic: the recipe rebuild stamps the recipe-described
channels + wires first; the replay then ADDS anything in the
snapshot that isn't already present. This is an ADDITIONS-ONLY
delta over the recipe base: a runtime removal of a snapshot-only
item stays removed (it isn't in the snapshot), but a runtime
removal of a RECIPE-defined channel/wire is recreated by the recipe
rebuild and NOT re-removed — surviving recipe-item removals needs
explicit tombstones. Edges are keyed by ``creature_id``; replay
silently skips ids the rebuilt graph doesn't carry, so id re-rolls
across resume can drop edges (stable-identity mapping is the
follow-up).
