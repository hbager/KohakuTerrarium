"""Reconciler — sync the central session index against the disk.

Two modes:

* ``full=True``      — re-read every file regardless of fingerprint.
                       Used for the initial bootstrap (when the
                       sidecar is empty) and for the explicit
                       "Rebuild index" button in the UI.
* ``full=False``     — only re-read files whose ``(mtime, size)``
                       fingerprint differs from what the sidecar
                       has cached.  Used by the periodic /
                       on-demand reconcile path that backs
                       ``?refresh=true`` on the listing endpoint.

In both modes we drop sidecar entries whose backing file is gone.
Parallelism uses a ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` capped at ``cpus * 4`` (32
ceiling) to keep the cold-bootstrap cost in line.

Lives in the ``session_index`` package so it can pull in
``SessionStore`` lazily — the reconciler is the one place that
opens individual session files; everything else reads from the
sidecar.
