# bash

Execute shell commands and return output.

## IMPORTANT: Prefer Dedicated Tools

Do NOT use bash for operations that have dedicated tools:
- File reading: use `read` (NOT `cat`, `head`, `tail`)
- File editing: use `edit` (NOT `sed`, `awk`)
- File writing: use `write` (NOT `echo >`, `cat <<EOF`)
- File finding: use `glob` (NOT `find`, `ls`)
- Content search: use `grep` (NOT `grep`, `rg` via bash)

Using dedicated tools gives structured output and enables safety guards.

## Arguments

| Arg | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| command | string | Shell command to execute (required) |
| type | string | Shell type: bash, zsh, sh, fish, pwsh, powershell (default: bash) |
| timeout | number | Maximum execution time in seconds for this call (default: tool config timeout; `0` = no timeout) |

## Shell Type

By default, all commands run in **bash** on every platform (including
Windows, via git bash). If bash is not available, the tool will report
which shells are installed so you can choose an alternative with
`type="..."`.

## Git Safety

- Prefer new commits over amending existing ones.
- Never skip hooks (--no-verify) unless explicitly asked.
- Before destructive operations (reset --hard, push --force), confirm with
  the user.
- Never force push to main/master.

## Multiple Commands

- Independent commands: run them separately (parallel execution).
- Dependent commands: chain with `&&`.
- Sequential (failure OK): chain with `;`.

## Behavior

- Commands run in bash on all platforms (git bash on Windows).
- Use `type` parameter to switch shell if bash is unavailable.
- stdout and stderr are combined in the output.
- Commands have a configurable timeout; pass `timeout` per call to override the tool default.
- `timeout: 0` disables the execution timeout for long-running commands.
- Large outputs may be truncated to the configured max size.

## WHEN TO USE

- Running system commands (git, npm, pip, cargo, etc.)
- Checking system state (pwd, whoami, env)
- Running build/test commands
- Package management operations

## Output

Returns combined stdout/stderr. Exit code is included in the result metadata.

## LIMITATIONS

- Commands have timeout (default: 60 seconds; override per call with `timeout`)
- Large outputs may be truncated
- Shell availability varies by platform (bash via git bash on Windows)
