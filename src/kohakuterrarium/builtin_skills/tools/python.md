# python

Execute Python code and return output.

## Arguments

| Arg | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| code | string | Python code to execute (required) |
| timeout | number | Maximum execution time in seconds for this call (default: tool config timeout; `0` = no timeout) |

## WHEN TO USE

- Quick computations or data transformations
- Testing code snippets
- Checking Python environment/packages
- Complex string/data processing

## Behavior

- Code runs in a separate subprocess using the current Python interpreter.
- Has access to all installed packages in the environment.
- stdout and stderr are captured and returned.
- Configurable timeout; pass `timeout` per call to override the tool default.
- `timeout: 0` disables the execution timeout for long-running snippets.

## Output

Returns combined stdout/stderr. Exit code is included in the result metadata.

## LIMITATIONS

- Runs in isolated subprocess (no state persistence between calls)
- Timeout applies (default: 60 seconds; override per call with `timeout`)
- Only packages installed in environment are available

## TIPS

- Use `print()` to output results
- For file operations, prefer `read`/`write` tools
- Check package availability before using
