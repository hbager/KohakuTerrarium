"""
Discord Adventure Bot — agents as NPC characters in an interactive RPG.

Unlike the agent-first example in ``examples/agent-apps/discord_bot``,
this program owns Discord interactions and invokes agents only as NPCs.

Here, the Discord bot is the main program. It has its own slash
commands, button interactions, thread management, game state machine.
Agents are NPC characters: created on demand, fed game context by
the bot, and destroyed when the adventure ends.

Why programmatic access?
  - discord.py owns the event loop — agents don't run autonomously
  - Agent configs are generated dynamically per NPC (personality,
    knowledge, relationship to player — all computed at runtime)
  - Game state machine in bot code decides WHEN to invoke which NPC
  - Discord interactions (buttons, embeds, threads) are the UI —
    agent output is just text placed into embeds by bot code
  - Multiple agents per adventure, created/destroyed per session

    pip install discord.py kohakuterrarium
