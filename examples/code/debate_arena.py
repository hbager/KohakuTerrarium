"""
Debate Arena — multi-agent debate with external turn control.

Three agents:
  - Proposer: argues FOR a position
  - Opponent: argues AGAINST
  - Judge: evaluates each round, declares winner

Uses the composition algebra:
  - ``await agent(config)`` for persistent agents
  - ``>>`` to pipe output through transforms
  - ``async for`` to loop rounds with native control flow

Why code, not a terrarium recipe?
  Terrarium channels broadcast peer events, while this debate requires
  strict proposer → opponent → judge sequencing. Native control flow
  makes that turn protocol explicit.

Usage:
    python debate_arena.py "AI will replace most white-collar jobs within 10 years"
